"Podziel siÄ™" is a mobile application for Android and iOS users, designed for foodsharing purposes. The aim of the project was to create a platform which allows free and easy sharing of food with other users: people with excess food or ready-made products can pass them on to users who are willing to receive them. The work presents a detailed description of the application and the overall architecture of the project, as well as the process of its creation.
